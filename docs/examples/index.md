# Tutorials

The example notebooks have several additional dependencies that need to installed in
addition to `hysetter`. You can install all the dependencies using `micromamba` (or
`conda` or `mamba`) by downloading the `environment.yml` file from
[here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hyriver/hysetter/main/environment.yml) and
creating the environment using:

```bash
micromamba env create -f environment.yml
```
